# Security Policy for KTM-EduTech

## Introduction

I prioritize the security of KTM-EduTech and the safety of our users. This document outlines how you can securely report any security vulnerabilities you may discover in my project.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you find a security vulnerability in KTM-EduTech, please follow these steps to report it securely:

1. **Do Not Disclose Publicly**: Please avoid sharing details of the vulnerability publicly until I have addressed it. This helps protect our users and systems.

2. **Contact Me Directly**: Report the vulnerability to me through the following channels:
   - **Email**: Send a detailed description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce and potential impact, to [admin@kydmasong.net](mailto:admin@kydmasong.net).
   - **Private GitHub Issues**: Alternatively, you can open a private issue on my GitHub repository. Label it as "Security" and provide detailed information.

3. **Provide Detailed Information**: When reporting a vulnerability, please include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested fixes or mitigations

4. **Follow Up**: After you submit your report, I will acknowledge receipt and begin investigating the issue. I may reach out for more details or clarification.

## What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: I will acknowledge receipt of your report and start assessing the issue.
- **Investigation**: I will investigate the vulnerability and determine its impact.
- **Resolution**: I will work on a fix or mitigation and keep you updated on the progress.
- **Disclosure**: Once the vulnerability is resolved, I will consider the appropriate way to disclose the issue and my response, ensuring that any public information does not compromise security.

## Scope of the Policy

This policy applies to security vulnerabilities in the KTM-EduTech project, including but not limited to:

- **Code Vulnerabilities**: Issues in the source code that could lead to security breaches.
- **Configuration Weaknesses**: Problems in the configuration of systems, services, or infrastructure that could be exploited.
- **Dependency Issues**: Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or dependencies used by the project.
- **Authentication and Authorization Flaws**: Problems related to user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Data Protection**: Weaknesses in the handling and storage of sensitive data.

The policy does not cover:

- General security best practices that do not pertain to specific vulnerabilities within the project.
- Issues that are related to user behavior or interactions that do not directly affect the security of the software.

## Updates to the Policy

I may update this security policy periodically to reflect changes in the project, address new security concerns, or improve our response procedures. Hereâ€™s how updates will be handled:

- **Notification**: Updates to the policy will be communicated through the KTM-EduTech GitHub repository. It is important to review the policy regularly to stay informed about any changes.
- **Versioning**: Each update will be accompanied by a version number and a summary of changes made. This will help track modifications and understand the evolution of the policy.
- **Feedback**: I welcome feedback on the policy. If you have suggestions or concerns about the policy or its updates, please contact me at [admin@kydmasong.net](mailto:admin@kydmasong.net).

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
